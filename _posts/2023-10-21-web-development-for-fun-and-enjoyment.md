A couple of weeks ago I came to the realisation that building for the web is not only what I'm good at, it's what brings me joy. This may seem like a strange realisation given I design software for a living. However, my roles over the last few years have moved away from building what I design as part of my day-to-day work.

I wanted to change this. Over the last few weeks I've picked up some half-completed projects and started some new ones.

Firstly, I shipped three new static pages for the [Hanani](https://hanamirb.org) web framework, including a [new project landing page](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/pull/1358). I love the Ruby programming language and have wanted an opportunity to contribute to a project in this ecosystem. It was fun working with the Hanami team on these pages and I'm looking forward to helping on future projects.

I've also started rebuilding [my wife's website](https://maryannemoodie.com). It's been a number of years since we launched the current site, and while the design has held up, we thought a brand and content refresh was needed.

The current site is built using Ruby on Rails. At the time this was the tool I was most familiar with, and the one that provided the outcome we needed. I'm rebuilding the new site using Next JS, both because it seems a better fit for the project and also to improve my Next JS knowledge.

You may have also noticed that this site has had a little refresh. I took some time this week to clean up the design and the code. There are more improvements to make, but I'm enjoying the direction this look and feel has takenâ€”especially the aspects that make use of [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi) and fluid responsive design.

These are small projects, but they represent a big shift in my thinking. I'd forgotten how much I've missed building for the web and how much I've missed building *for the joy of building*. It's nice to be back here.
