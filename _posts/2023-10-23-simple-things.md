I like simple things. Simple recipes. Simple furniture. Simple architecture. 

Simple doesn't mean basic, nor is it easy. Simple is hard work.

Simple is enough; no more or less than it should be. Simple does what is needed and does it well.

Simple is delightful. And often surprising. Simple is elusive, but usually obvious.

Simple is a destination, but it's also a guide.

Simple is what I strive for. Simple pushes me forward.
