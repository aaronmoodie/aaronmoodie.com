Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site has been running in many shapes and forms since 2004. While a lot of what I originally posted here has been lost, I'm endeavouring to treat this site as more of a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) moving forward.

This page is a WIP. More soon.

<!-- So a little about myself. I've been working as a designer for the last 20 years. Over that time I've worked on many amazing and interesting projects. -->
