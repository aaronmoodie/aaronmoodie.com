Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little corner of the internet. This site has been running in many shapes and forms since 2004. While a lot of what I originally posted here has been lost, I'm endeavouring to treat this site as more of a [digital garden](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/) moving forward.

Iâ€™m a passionate and thoughtful designer leader working to solve interesting problems and build products that put people first.

For the last 20 years Iâ€™ve worked across many aspects of the design industry, from running a graphic design studio and creating logotypes, to designing mobile apps and leading product design teams.

Right now Iâ€™m at [Surreal](https://surreal.live) building a new platform to support live entertainment. I love working inclusively and strive to make the design process as collaborative as possible. The most valuable experiences in my process are the ones where I learn something new, and Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to challenge my perception and gain a new perspective.

A good day is one where Iâ€™m able to improve my understanding of design and evolve my process, alongside learning to be a better leader, friend and human.

I enjoy hearing from people, so please [send me an email](mailto:hello@aaronmoodie.com) and say hello.
