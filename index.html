    <h1>Aaron Moodie</h1>
    <p>Product Designer</p>
  </header>
  <p>
    I'm a designer who loves coding, collaborating with amazing people, and building great products. Over the last 20 years, I've led and contributed to a range of projects—from high-profile brand identities to notable iOS apps and large-scale digital products. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, I'm leading product design at <a href="https://surreal.live">Surreal</a>—where we're building great software to help manage live entertainment. Previously I was at <a href="http://acloudguru.com">A Cloud Guru</a>, <a href="https://www.ubercarshare.com/">Car Next Door</a> (now Uber Carshare) and <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>.
