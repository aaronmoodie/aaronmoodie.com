    <p>Product Designer</p>
  </header>
  <p>
    I'm a designer who loves coding, collaborating with amazing people, and building great products. Over the last 20 years, I've led and contributed to a range of projects—from high-profile brand identities to notable iOS apps and large-scale digital products.

  <p>
    Currently I’m at <a href="https://xero.com">Xero</a>, building finance tools to support small businesses and their accountants. Previously I was at <a href="http://surreal.live">Surreal</a>, <a href="http://acloudguru.com">A Cloud Guru</a>, Car Next Door (now <a href="https://www.ubercarshare.com/">Uber Carshare</a>) and <a href="https://etsy.com">Etsy</a>.
