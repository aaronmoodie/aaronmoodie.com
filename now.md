title: "What I‚Äôm doing now"
---

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). It's a snapshot of what's currently happening in my life.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with my [talented wife](https://instagram.com/maryannemoodie) and our two boys, aged 7 and 9. I work as a Principal Product Designer at [Muso](http://muso.live). When I'm not creating a better future for live music, I'm tinkering on a side project, making music or thinking about what matters for the future of people and our planet.

### Interests

Alongside my current work, I spend my time learning about and improving on topics I find exciting and fulfilling. These currently include:

- Writing
- Making music
- Type
- Discovering new music
- NFTs, DAOs and the blockchain
- Next JS
- Advanced JavaScript concepts
- Permaculture
- Renewable technologies
