title: "What I‚Äôm doing now"
---

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). It's a snapshot of what's currently happening in my life.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with my [talented wife](https://instagram.com/maryannemoodie) and our two boys, aged 5 and 8. I work as a Principal Product Designer at [A Cloud Guru](http://acloud.guru), where my current focus is DesignOps and Systems. I recently finished up a 12 month role as a general member of [Ruby AU](https://ruby.org.au), and am still actively part of the community. I'm really looking forward to seeing everyone at the next [Rails Camp](https://railscamp.com.au). ü§û

### Interests

Alongside my current work, I spend my time learning about and improving on topics I find exciting and fulfilling. These currently include:

- Programming
- Writing
- Music & community
- [Clean technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_technology)
- Permaculture
- [Marine permaculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Permaculture)
- Meditation
- [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)
