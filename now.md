title: "What I’m doing now"
---

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). It's a snapshot of what's currently happening in my life.

I live in Melbourne, Australia with my [talented wife](https://maryannemoodie.com) and our two boys. I work as a Principal Product Designer at [Xero](http://xero.com). When I'm not creating a better future for live experiences, I'm tinkering on a side project—usually music related, working in the garden or reading a book.

### Interests

Alongside improving my practice and craft, I spend my time learning about topics I find exciting and fulfilling. These currently include:

- Writing
- Hiking
- Music
- Programming
- Type
- Permaculture
- Australian native gardens
- Mindfulness
- Zettelkasten
